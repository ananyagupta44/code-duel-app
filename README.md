## What is CodeDuel?

CodeDuel is a real-time 1v1 (and tournament) competitive coding platform. Two players are given the same problem and race to solve it. Code is executed live against hidden test cases via Judge0. ELO ratings shift after every match. Spectators can watch both editors simultaneously as the battle unfolds.

It's built on a **Next.js App Router** frontend and a separate **Express.js** backend, connected by Socket.io for all the real-time state — match events, live code updates, spectator feeds, and tournament bracket progression.

---

## Features

### Dueling
- **Live 1v1 matches** — both players write code in a Monaco editor; test cases run on Judge0 in real time
- **Multi-language support** — JavaScript, Python, C++ (GCC 9.2), Java, and more via Judge0
- **Real-time progress bars** — visible to both the player and any spectators as test cases pass
- **ELO ranking system** — ratings update automatically after every match result

### Lobby & Matchmaking
- Public lobby showing all online players with their ELO, status, and language preference
- Challenge specific players or queue for auto-matchmaking
- AI bot opponents with adjustable ELO restrictions for practice
- Contextual "Find Your Game" UX that adapts copy based on ranked vs. casual mode

### Tournaments
- Create brackets with any number of players
- Single-elimination bracket with auto-generated connector lines and round progression
- Live tournament cards with a real-time remaining-player counter per current round
- Register for upcoming tournaments; bracket auto-advances after each match result
- Hero stats row: live count, active matches, upcoming scheduled, total players competing
- Champion banner and winner reveal on tournament completion
- Socket-based bracket updates pushed to every client watching

### Spectator Mode
- Watch any live match with read-only Monaco editors for both players
- Floating **Live Feed** panel showing timestamped match events in real time
- **Match timer** ticking from the moment the match starts
- **LEADING** badge + teal glow on whichever player is ahead in test-case progress
- Language pill and ELO displayed per player
- Custom `duelDark` Monaco theme matching the platform's visual identity


### Practice
- Dedicated practice mode with no ELO on the line — ideal for warming up or learning a new language
- Problems filterable by difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard) and topic (Arrays, Trees, DP, Graphs, etc.)
- Solve against AI bots at adjustable skill levels to build confidence before ranked play
- Submission history per problem so you can revisit and improve past solutions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- MongoDB (local instance or MongoDB Atlas connection string)
- Judge0 instance — for development you can use the public `https://ce.judge0.com` endpoint (rate-limited); for production, [self-host Judge0](https://github.com/judge0/judge0/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### 1 — Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/codeduel.git
cd codeduel
```

### 2 — Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/codeduel
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JUDGE0_URL=https://ce.judge0.com        # or your self-hosted instance
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3 — Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
